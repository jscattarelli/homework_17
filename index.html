            <p>I’m a design-minded product manager and user researcher specializing in educational technology. </p>
            <p>My experiences as an English instructor in South Korea and St. Paul, Minn, and as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Brazil, inspired me to want to build products that help instructors be more effective for all kinds of learners. Currently, I’m working as a product manager at Top Hat and pursuing a master’s degree in educational psychology at the University of Minnesota. </p>
            <p>My approach to user research combines methods from psychology, anthropology, and creative writing. I love finding the perfect question to get users to open up, and helping them articulate their perspective to others. </p>
            <p>In addition to learning about others, I enjoy praticing martial arts, gardening, and mysteries. </p>
